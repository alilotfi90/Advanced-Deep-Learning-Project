# Advanced-Deep-Learning-Project
This repository is made for the project I will be doing for Advanced Deep Learning class.

This project was completed using the Sorghum-100 dataset, which can be found at the following link:

1.2 statistics.on.data.ipynb
1.3tsna_analysis.ipynb

2- Various Modified Models:

2.1 Efficient.Net.Sorgh.py
2.2 Mobile.Net.opt.model.ipynb
2.3 ResNet50.modified.ipynb
2.4 ResNet50_modified.ipynb
2.5 mobile.net.v2.py
2.6 model2.ipynb

3- Weights:
